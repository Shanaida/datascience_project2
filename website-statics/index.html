                    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
                    <p> Our team has chosen this topic for our second project because itâ€™s of our 
                        interest to visualize historical macroeconomic and stock data with our current economic 
                        market state in mind. We have decided to implement this type of data on this
                        website by creating a dashboard page that hosts great visualizations. During this project's
                        implementation, we learned about the HighCharts js library and used it to script some charts
                        for our dashboard. </p>
                        
                    <p> To account for user interaction, we have allowed for user functions on the 
                        views/filter of the graphs. We have also created the Stock API page, where
                        a user can input a stock symbol in order to get more information about that
                        stock. We had a lot of fun working on this project and hope you enjoy the content! </p>
