Project Summary: 
We would like to propose a project on Macroeconomic Trends and Stock Market data. We have chosen this topic because it’s of our interest to visualize historical macroeconomic data and stock data with our current economic market state in mind. We have decided that this type of data gives an opportunity of creating great charts in a dashboard page. We would also like to use other js chart libraries to present the versatility of the chart types with the different data sets. We plan to make our webpage interactive where users can dynamically change the charts displayed by filtering on dates or amount ranges. We will be making the Yahoo Stock Api data interactive where users will be able to enter in a stock label in order to find out more information about the stock. To come to an end, our webpage will be a whole macro view on the market with specific stock information, where the user plays a role in what data is visualized on the page.
